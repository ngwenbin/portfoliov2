          Hi, Iâ€™m Wen Bin. Nice to meet you.
        </p>
        Since beginning my first foray into engineering some 7 years ago, I've
        dabbled in various fields of engineering - Mechanical, Aerospace, IoT,
        with software being my favorite. I appreciate the endless possibilities
        of what one can achieve with a simple laptop. I'm naturally curious,
        unforgivably determined, and perpetually working on trying to
        over-engineer something.
